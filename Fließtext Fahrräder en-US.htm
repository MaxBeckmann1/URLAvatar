Greeting
Hey, nice to meet you! I see you're looking for a new bike. How about I show you a few options and together we can find the best bike for you?
If you like to ride fast and cover long distances, a road bike is for you! With a lightweight and aerodynamic design and narrow tyres, you can go on long and demanding tours. The road bike offers you the perfect balance between speed and comfort and you can fully concentrate on your training or adventures.
If you are more of a thrill seeker and like to ride on rough terrain, a mountain bike could be the perfect bike for you. With wider tyres and a sturdy construction, a mountain bike is ideal for difficult terrain. Whether you prefer a speedy downhill ride or a challenging mountain tour, you'll always feel like you can handle anything.
But maybe you are looking for a bike for everyday use or for short distances in the city. In this case, a city e-bike would be a great option for you. With an e-bike you can cover longer distances effortlessly and still be environmentally friendly. A city e-bike is comfortable and practical and you can use it for your daily errands or for a relaxing trip through the city.
Just tell me what is most important to you: speed, adventure or convenience? What do you mainly want to use your bike for? Together we will find the perfect bike for you!








Mountain bike
If you are an outdoor enthusiast looking for adventure in nature, a mountain bike is the perfect choice for you. It gives you the freedom to get off the beaten track and master all types of terrain. From relaxed off-road fun to action-packed challenges in rough terrain, the mountain bike offers you everything you need. The best part is that you only have to choose the right model for you.
Mountain bikes differ from everyday bikes and road bikes in their geometry and specific components such as large-volume tyres, robust frames, suspension systems, powerful disc brakes and derailleurs with mountain-ready gearing. There is a wide range of different MTB designs, each designed for specific purposes.
Modern MTBs have wheels in 27.5 inch and 29 inch sizes. The smaller version offers more agility and manoeuvrability, while the larger wheels offer more traction and better grip on uneven surfaces. The tyre width varies between 2.1 and 2.5 inches. For grip and traction on extremely soft surfaces such as snow or sand, you can even choose a fatbike with a tyre width of up to 5 inches.
